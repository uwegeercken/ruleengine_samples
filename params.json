Once you have completed this, restart PDI and you are ready to go.\r\n\r\nNote 2: the PDI jobs and transformation samples have some default parameters for paths to folders and/or files. Make sure that you adjust these before or when running the job or transformation.\r\n\r\nlast update: uwe geercken - 2016-07-19",

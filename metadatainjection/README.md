this sample job and transformation uses:

- metadata injection to inject field name, data types, etc into the transformation
- the JaRE ruleengine plugin to run business rules against the data from a CSV file

can be used dynamically to process and check different input files.

note that this example does not show the metadata injection for the rule engine step. but the rule
engine step does support metadata injection - it is just not shown in this example.

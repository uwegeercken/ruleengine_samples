# ruleengine_samples

Contains samples of how you can use the ruleengine in different scenarios.

- discount: calculate a discount using the ruleengine
- metadatainjection: dynamically process CSV files using metadata injection and the ruleengine


Note: you will need the JaRE plugin for Pentaho PDI installed to try the samples. Simply start Pentaho PDI, select "Tools" and then "Marketplace" from the menu and then search for "JaRE" or "rule" and simply install the plugin. Once you have completed this, restart PDI and you are ready to go.

Note 2: the PDI jobs and transformation samples have some default parameters for paths to folders and/or files. Make sure that you adjust these before or when running the job or transformation.
